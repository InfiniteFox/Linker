This is able to return most of the output.
Once the program run, you need to keyborad input the path of the input file.
Then it will print out the output.

Some problem:
1. In some type E code, if the code it points to doesn't have a value yet, it can't make the code point to that.
2. I use Scanner to input, so the program might time out.
